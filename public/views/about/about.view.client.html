            <translate>This builder allows you to invite people to receive an email series from you.
                After they signup, emails will be sent from you, in an automated, timed way. They will be sent from your email address. And people who sign up will be able to reply to you with their thoughts or questions.
                You will know how many people have signed up, who they are, and how far along they are in the series.
                You will have their email address and will be able to reach out to them, to see if they have any questions, or perhaps invite them to meet with you or come to an event.
